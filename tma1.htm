    	<p>
    		My Interpretation: There are in total four parts in the project. 
    		<ul>
    			<li>Part 1 is to apply knowledge about XML and create my resume in the format of XML, then display it. 
    			</li>
    			<li>Part 2 is to create a web teaching system to help users learn the knowledge covered in the first three units in COMP466.
    			</li> 
    			<li>Part 3 is to demonstrate the function of slideshow using canvas technology. 
    			</li>
    			<li>Part 4 is to build three utility tools which specifically achieve some functionality.
    			</li>
    		</ul>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		My Analysis and Design: 
    		<ul>
    			<li>For part 1, check W3Cschool and look at the textbook to understand the basic syntax and format required in XML to create a resume, then transform it into XSD type. Construct the display style in XSL file. Make sure every step is well-formatted and bug-free.
    			</li>
    			<li>For part 2, construct a web application system. Make sure no necessary function is missing and complete the system with quality assurance. Make sure the system is well tested.a\
    			</li> 
    			<li>For part 3, search about canvas and apply the technology to create slideshow.
    			</li>
    			<li>For part 4, the third utility tool should be similar to the first two. Make sure all the functionality in the three tools are working. It is also helpful to see how the others online who build such tools to get a feeling of what make the tools useful.
    			</li>
    		</ul>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		My Implementation: 
    		<ul>
    			<li>For part 1, write all the contents required into the resume using XML syntax, and then generate XSD file. Finally write XSLT with user-friendly style. Test the output in a browser.</li>
    			<li>For part 2, use the same thinking logic to this part as main page construction. Make sure the whole system is user-friendly and bug-free. All the features are well tested.
    			</li>
    			<li>For part 3, use all the technologies needed and make sure the output meets all the requirements.
    			</li>
    			<li>For part 4, build all the utility tools with their functionality working well.
    			</li>
    		</ul>
